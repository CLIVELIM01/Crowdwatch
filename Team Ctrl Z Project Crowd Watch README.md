# Project Crowdwatch

Project CrowdWatch is a project aims to provide a solution to crowd control and public security. Team Ctrl Z aims to solve this by utilising MicroJava Technologies with a Microbit and IOS compatibility.

## Installation
To run the file, you have to run the code via Javascript on makecode.microbit.org

Afterwards, download the code into the microbit via usb. Once your microbit has the program, pair the microbit with your IOS device to run the program


## Process Workflow
Welcome to the Crowdwatch

Overview:
Our system ensures user safety and efficient crowd management during a large scale venue visit. Follow the instructions below for a smooth and secure experience.

1. App Download and Venue Entry
- Download the CrowdWatch from the App Store or Google Play before arriving at the venue.
- Upon entry, use the app to view your location and check crowd density. This will help you avoid overcrowded zones.

2. Emergency Alerts
- If you encounter an emergency, press buttons A+B on your Crowdwatch device.
- This action will send a “HELP” notification to the app and alert the organizers.

3. Organizers' Response
- The app will update you on the organizers’ progress as they assess the emergency.
- Stay tuned to the app for real-time updates and instructions.

4. Evacuation Instructions
- Once the emergency is confirmed, the app will provide evacuation routes.
- Your Crowdwatch device will use Bluetooth to guide you with clear directions for evacuation.


## Running the code

To run the code, connection the microbit into your PC and open makecode.microbit.org

Once you are in the page, upload the main code file under javascript and download the program to the microbit

Next, when the code is programmed into the microbit, pair the microbit with the IOS Device via bluetooth and test the code. As this the MVP, we are utilising the Microbit IOS app to test the bluetooth compatibility and see if it receive the input and output 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the minimal viable product created by Team Ctrl Z has officially demonstrated the successful input and output via bluetooth technology. We strongly believe that this product has a high potential to reach greater heights if more time and resources was given to this project. Considering that Singapore has one of the highest tourism rate and a central global hub for many corporations, we strongly concur that this project could provide people with a safer experience attending large-scale events while also enjoying their time.
